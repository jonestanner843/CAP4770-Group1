# CAP4770-Group1
1. Problem Statement & Background (10 pts)
Using supply chain GHG emission factor data by NAICS code, we aim to cluster similar emission profiles, detect emission anomalies, and model predictors of emission intensity.

We can explain why this matters

Summarize and cite academic references.

Include context and limitations.

🛢️ 2. Load Data into MySQL & Access in Jupyter (10 pts)
Import the dataset into a MySQL database.

Use LOAD DATA INFILE

Connect Jupyter Lab to MySQL using Python 

Fetch the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

🧹 3. Data Collection & Preprocessing (10 pts)
Describe the source of the data.

Clean the dataset (handle missing values, encoding, scaling, normalization).

Explain the preprocessing choices you made.

📊 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (10 pts)
Generate at least 3 visualizations or summary tables (e.g., bar plots, histograms, heatmaps).


🤖 5. Data Modeling (10 pts)
Use at least one or more data mining/machine learning models (e.g. decision trees, clustering, SVM, KNN, etc.)

Split into train/test or use cross-validation.

Evaluate using appropriate metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.

📈 6. Results & Interpretation (10 pts)
Present your results using charts, metrics, confusion matrices, or tables.


🧱 7. Code Quality (10 pts)
Structure your notebook with:

Markdown headers & sections

Comments explaining code

Functions if appropriate

Clean, readable formatting

🗣️ 8. Presentation Slides (10 pts)
Use PowerPoint or Google Slides:

Slide 1: Title + team members

Slide 2: Problem overview

Slide 3: Dataset + preprocessing

Slide 4: Visuals/EDA

Slide 5: Models used

Slide 6: Results

Slide 7: Key lessons learned

Keep text readable and graphics meaningful.

🎤 9. Presentation Video (within slide submission)
7–10 minutes long.

Include:

Problem overview

Dataset explanation

Demonstration of code/EDA/model results

Key findings and challenges

📚 10. References & Citations (5 pts)
Use proper citation format (APA, IEEE, etc.) in both your report and slides.

Include:

Data sources

Research papers

Any libraries/tools documentation used

📦 11. Final Submission Package (5 pts)
Submit the following:

Final PDF Report (Final_Report.pdf)

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

Presentation Slides + Video

Dataset file(s)

GitHub repo (recommended): Create a project folder under cap4770 repo and include all files
